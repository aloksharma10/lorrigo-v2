# Billing System Enhancements Summary

## Overview
Successfully implemented comprehensive billing system enhancements based on the provided MongoDB schema, transforming the system from basic CSV billing to an advanced dispute-aware platform.

## âœ… Database Schema Updates

### New Models Added:
1. **UserProfile** - Enhanced user settings with payment modes, wallet, remittance configuration
2. **WeightDispute** - Automated weight dispute detection and management
3. **BillingCycle** - Configurable billing cycles (automatic/manual)
4. **Enhanced Billing** - Comprehensive billing records with dispute tracking

### New Enums:
- PaymentMode (PREPAID, POSTPAID, COMBINED)
- WeightDisputeStatus (PENDING, UNDER_REVIEW, RESOLVED, REJECTED)
- BillingCycleType (AUTOMATIC, MANUAL, CUSTOM)
- BillingStatus (PENDING, PROCESSING, COMPLETED, FAILED)
- RemittanceCycle (DAILY, WEEKLY, FORTNIGHTLY, MONTHLY)

## âœ… Enhanced API Features

### New Service Methods:
- `detectWeightDisputes()` - Automatic weight dispute detection during CSV upload
- `processManualBilling()` - Admin-initiated billing for specific orders
- `createAutomaticBillingCycle()` - Billing cycle management
- Enhanced billing record creation with dispute tracking

### New API Endpoints:
- `POST /billing/manual/:userId` - Manual billing processing
- `POST /billing/cycle/:userId` - Create billing cycles
- Enhanced existing endpoints with weight dispute data

## âœ… Weight Dispute System

### Features Implemented:
- **Automatic Detection**: CSV uploads detect weight discrepancies (>0.1kg tolerance)
- **Dispute Creation**: Automatic dispute record creation for weight differences
- **Visual Indicators**: UI shows disputed weights with badges and alerts
- **Admin Review**: Dispute management workflow for admins

## âœ… Enhanced UI Components

### Updated Components:
- **WeightDetailsCell**: Shows weight disputes with visual indicators
- **PaymentStatusCell**: Enhanced payment status with processing info
- **BillingCodeCell**: Copy functionality for billing codes
- **Enhanced Tables**: Comprehensive data display with filtering

### Key Improvements:
- Weight dispute badges and alerts
- Copy functionality for all relevant data
- Enhanced filtering and search
- Visual weight difference indicators
- Payment status tracking

## âœ… Billing Flow Enhancements

### CSV Upload Process:
1. File validation and header checking
2. Automatic weight dispute detection
3. Background processing with progress tracking
4. Dispute record creation for problematic weights

### Manual Billing:
1. Admin control for specific users/orders
2. Date range or AWB-based selection
3. Approval tracking and audit trail

## âœ… Data Model Enhancements

### Enhanced BillingRecord Interface:
```typescript
interface BillingRecord {
  // ... existing fields
  original_weight: number;
  weight_difference: number;
  has_weight_dispute: boolean;
  cycle_type: string | null;
  is_manual_billing: boolean;
  order: {
    // ... existing fields
    weight_dispute?: {
      id: string;
      dispute_id: string;
      status: string;
      original_weight: number;
      disputed_weight: number;
      final_weight?: number;
    } | null;
  };
}
```

## ðŸš€ Key Benefits Achieved

1. **Enhanced Data Clarity**: All billing fields clearly displayed with weight dispute information
2. **Improved User Experience**: Modular components, copy functionality, visual indicators
3. **Automated Dispute Management**: Automatic detection and tracking of weight discrepancies
4. **Admin Control**: Manual billing capabilities with audit trails
5. **Comprehensive Tracking**: Full billing cycle and dispute lifecycle management

## ðŸ“Š Technical Implementation

- **Database**: Enhanced Prisma schema with new models and relationships
- **Backend**: Enhanced service layer with dispute detection and manual billing
- **Frontend**: Modular React components with TypeScript type safety
- **API**: RESTful endpoints with comprehensive data handling

## ðŸ”§ Files Modified/Created

### Backend:
- `packages/db/schema/schema.prisma` - Enhanced schema
- `apps/api/src/modules/billing/services/billing-service.ts` - Enhanced service
- `apps/api/src/modules/billing/controllers/billing-controller.ts` - New endpoints

### Frontend:
- `apps/web/lib/apis/billing.ts` - Enhanced TypeScript interfaces
- `apps/web/components/tables/billing/billing-field-components.tsx` - Enhanced components
- Both user and admin billing tables already using enhanced components

The billing system is now a comprehensive, dispute-aware platform that provides clear visibility into all billing aspects while maintaining excellent user experience and administrative control.
